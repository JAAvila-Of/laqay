# Windows integration validation

All image-paste scenarios below are **not run**. The current implementation is
a read-only Shell diagnostic; compilation does not verify desktop behavior.
Run the matrix on Windows 10 and Windows 11 and record the OS build and results.

| ID | Scenario | Required result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T01 | Region screenshot | PNG in active folder |
| T02 | Full-screen screenshot | PNG in active folder |
| T03 | PNG with alpha | Exact dimensions and alpha preserved |
| T04 | Regular copied file | Native paste |
| T05 | Multiple copied files | Native paste |
| T06 | Text clipboard | Native behavior |
| T07 | Notepad | Native paste |
| T08 | VS Code | Native paste |
| T09 | Rider | Native paste |
| T10 | Windows Terminal | Native paste |
| T11 | Browser | Native paste |
| T12 | Explorer address bar | Native paste |
| T13 | Explorer search | Native paste |
| T14 | Rename field | Native paste |
| T15 | Multiple Explorer windows | Correct foreground folder |
| T16 | Windows 11 tabs | Active tab or safe rejection |
| T17 | Local directory | PNG created |
| T18 | Writable UNC directory | PNG created |
| T19 | Read-only directory | Safe failure, no incomplete file |
| T20 | Virtual folder | Native behavior |
| T21 | Rapid paste and key repeat | No overwrite or unintended duplicates |
| T22 | Empty clipboard | Native behavior |
| T23 | Locked clipboard | Safe failure |
| T24 | Large image | No UI freeze |
| T25 | Disabled | Native behavior |
| T26 | Second instance | No duplicate hook |
| T27 | Startup preference | Starts on login only when enabled |
| T28 | Tray exit | Clean resource teardown |
| T29 | Tab changes during paste | No write to unintended folder |
| T30 | Clipboard changes during paste | No stale image write |
| T31 | Virtual files with image formats | Native Shell transfer |
| T32 | Disk full or share disconnected | No incomplete output |

For the initial diagnostic, compare reported paths and focus against the real UI
with multiple tabs, address/search fields, rename controls, and virtual folders.
Never use a cached diagnostic snapshot to suppress a later key event.
